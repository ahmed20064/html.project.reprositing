<h2>Some of the most common forms of mobile computing devices are as given below:
Portable computers, compact, lightweight units including a full character set keyboard and primarily intended as hosts for software that may be parameterized, such as laptops/desktops, smartphones/tablets, etc.
Smart cards that can run multiple applications but are typically used for payment, travel, and secure area access.
Mobile phones, telephony devices which can call from a distance through cellular networking technology.
Wearable computers, mostly limited to functional keys and primarily intended as the incorporation of software agents, such as bracelets, key-less implants, etc.
These classes are expected to endure and to complement each other, none replacing another completely.</h2>
